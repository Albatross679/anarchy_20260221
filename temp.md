This is a hackathon competition team. this is the "anarchy" team.  include this information in the @README.md   


Create a markdown file to explain the structure of the data set.


do we have actual and expected energy consumption data?

how do we train this model? if we don't have the labels.


does huggingface package have regression models?

You can identify facilities whose energy use is unusually sensitive to temperature or shows consistently elevated baseline load—signals that may indicate inefficiency or opportunity.


what does load-signals mean here?

how can we train a model to determine whether a building a more sensitive to temperature changing?

tell me about the time series data in this dataset. should we use cnn or transformers to handle them? and what should we do when we have both time-series data and non time series data (age)?

Show me the structure of the neural network model. and where it is defined
